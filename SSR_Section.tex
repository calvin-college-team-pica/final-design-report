The smart breakers make up the part of the full system that measures power to each individual circuit and consist of a monitoring section and a switching section. Designing the two functions into the same subsystem allows for a simpler and safer installation. Without the switching capability, the user would have to add the monitoring component outside of their breaker panel, which adds more electrical connections and would likely require a new design for the breaker box. As a whole, the smart breakers were designed to be more of a proof of concept than as a final design. Much of this came from the fact that very few systems exist that provide individual circuit level information on a large scale.
