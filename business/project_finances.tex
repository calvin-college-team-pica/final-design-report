\subsection{Project Finances}
\subsubsection{Bill of Materials}
Through the Senior Design class, the Calvin College Engineering department provided \$750 for prototype parts. Since the project has a large scope, the team needs to minimize the cost of any single part to stay within the given budget. As such, the team chose several parts more because of their low cost rather than for functionality. For example, the team sought donations and free samples whenever possible, including the TI MSP430 development kit from Texas Instruments and the ADE7763 power monitoring chips from Analog Devices. The Bill of Materials table shows all parts that were bought and used in final design, bought but not used in final design, and parts that were donated.

\subsubsection{Board Cost}
After all the dimensions were found on the parts, the Visio drawings were done in order to try to get a minimum board size to create a PCB. The PCB price was found using PCBExpress. The team did not need to pay for the PCBs originally because that service was donated by Johnson Controls Incorporated. However, if the team were to go into production they would not have this luxury. Therefore, in order to get an accurate Bill of Materials, this cost needed to be estimated at retail price along with all of the donated parts by various organizations.

\subsubsection{Labor Charges}
Throughout the first and second semester, the team has kept a log of how many hours they worked. Determining the cost of labor for both semesters can accurately be assessed based on these records. For second semester so far, the team has logged 490.75 hours, with another 127.75 estimated before the end of the semester. The team also logged 388 hours for first semester, putting the yearlong total at about 1006.5 hours. Assuming engineers are paid \$100 an hour, the first semester labor cost is \$38,800, the second semester cost is \$61,850, making the full labor costs for the project \$100,650 as calculated in table \ref{tab:projecthours}.
