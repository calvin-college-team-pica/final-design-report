\section{Business Strategy}
\subsection{Desired image and position in market}
PICA seeks to be known as a leader in making consumers energy aware. This primarily means providing relevant information in an easy-to-understand format that allows users to make informed decisions about their energy usage. Our position in the market will likely be a part of the ``green'' market, which has been rapidly growing. However, we would like to aim for the consumer oriented part of this market, rather than reaching out to the part of the market dealing with clean power generation.
%\subsection{Company goals and objectives}
%\subsubsection{Operational}
%An operational goal is to retain a company structure that allows for rapid expansion, possibly including other national markets.
%\subsubsection{Financial}
%One finance related goal of PICA is to be successful enough that the company can start to address the objectives stated above.
%\subsubsection{Other}
%One big goal the business hopes to address is the gap between the electrical consumer and provider by producing products that meet both the needs of the power companies and homeowners. 
\subsection{SWOT analysis}
\subsubsection{Strengths}
One big strength of the product is that in a single system it addresses problems that previously would require multiple, independent systems and products. Another strength is the solid state breakers, which in addition to providing usage information also have a faster response time and include a safe automatic reset option.
\subsubsection{Weaknesses}
The biggest weakness is the cost of the system. While users want to know the information provided, many are not willing to pay a lot for that information. 
\subsubsection{Opportunities}
The idea of solid state breakers for home usage is relatively new and has not been taken advantage of, so there is a lot of potential growth in that area.
\subsubsection{Threats}
A big threat is that other companies have already started to establish themselves in similar fields. The PICA system may not provide enough of an advantage over these systems to be successful in an area where consumers have started to use these other systems.
\subsection{Competitive strategy}
%\subsubsection{Cost leadership}
As there is a high cost associated with the PICA products, the company will rely less on cost to remain competitive than on the differentiation and focus of the company. 
%\subsubsection{Differentiation}
The company has already started to differentiate itself primarily through the development of the solid state breakers. The company is also different from many in how we provide solutions to more than one problem the consumer and power company may have.
%\subsubsection{Focus}
The company hopes to remain competitive by continuing to focus on more aspects of the problems associated with power usage than potential competitors do. Instead of providing a solution relating only to single outlet usage, PICA will provide devices that can all work together, leaving room for easy expansion when the customer decides they want even more information.
