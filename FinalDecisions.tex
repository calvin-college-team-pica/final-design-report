\subsection{Final Decisions}
To summarize, the individual circuit monitors consist of an Arduino Uno microcontroller and Analog Devices ADE7763 metering chip with input networks using a voltage divider and current transformer. The unit will communicate with the base station computer through the Arduino to computer interface directly, using SPI for communication between the ADE7763 and Arduino Uno. Minimal on/off displays and controls including LEDs and a physical switch will be provided to ensure user safety as well. The system will use a solid state relay to demonstrate that the microcontroller is able to control a switching device, but will use a yet to be determined technology for a marketable product.
